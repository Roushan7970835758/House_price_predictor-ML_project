# House_price_predictor-ML_project
This Machine Learning project, developed on Jupyter Notebook, predicts house prices based on various features using regression techniques. ML libraries such as scikit-learn, matplotlib, numpy, and pandas were utilized for data analysis, model training, and evaluation. Graphs were generated to visualize the data and showcase insights during the analysis process. The project demonstrates the application of regression algorithms to address real-world problems and provides a comprehensive understanding of house price prediction using machine learning techniques.
